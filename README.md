# cerebro-gruvbox
A dark Gruvbox theme for Cerebro.

## How to install
All you need to do is change Cerebro's theme in its config.json.
This is located in wherever the rest of Cerebro's stuff is. On
Mac it's in `~/Library/Application Support/Cerebro/config.json`.

Change the `theme` attribute to be the Gruvbox one. For example:

```javascript
{
...
  "theme": "/Users/<you>/.cerebro/gruvbox.css",
...
}
```

Then restart Gruvbox. You're golden.
